# SAL: SWAT4 swateliteforce mods Alternative Launcher

SAL is a minimal SWAT4 SEF based mod launcher. I made this initially for myself,
because I dislike dragging folders, finding the right app to extract them archives,
and starting all over again when a new SEF based mod is released. So I decided
to create this tool to automate all of that annoying process for myself. Also,
was really interested experimented in Elm architecture for desktop application,
so this is the result so far.

## Current Features

- Support auto extract of zip, rar and 7zip archives.
- Simplistic UI that allows you to click and forget, whether it is for
installation, uninstallation or just simply launching a mod.
- Access all (supported) SEF mods of multiple versions from a single app.
- User can review mod source links for security reasons *or*
add more mods of their choice into `configuration.json` file that comes with 
the software. No need to change the software code or rebuild the software.
- Free and open source, under MIT license.

### Disclaimer

I apologize for the terrible UI. I'm not a UI/UX designer and have to admit,
I'm terrible at it. Also, expect a lot of bugs during this phase.

## Version

v0.1.0
